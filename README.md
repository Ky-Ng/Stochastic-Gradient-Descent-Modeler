# Stochastic Gradient Descent: The Average Problem
Modeling Stochastic Gradient Descent with datasets containing varying ranges and random initializations to solve the task of finding the average of a dataset.
___
## Introduction
Below are samples of data with varying degrees of distributions with the datasets:
```
low_variation = [3, 4, 5]
med_variation = [3, 4, 5, 30]
high_variation = [3, 4, 5, 300]
```
and the corresponding number of epochs needed to descend onto the Ground Truth average.
